## About

Developed for internal use, HAZEL supports authors with writing, editing and updating Historic England's guidance literature. 

In its current form, HAZEL runs on a GPT 3.5-turbo model that has been tailored to provide suggestions in accordance with HE's tone of voice and style requirements. 

In this repository, you can find out more about the project. We have also created a user manual and prompt library that you may wish to consult while working with HAZEL.
