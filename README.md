# HAZEL: a prototype for an AI assistant for heritage guidance & policy development

Developed for internal use in collaboration with researchers at University of Edinburgh, HAZEL supports authors with writing, editing and updating Historic England's guidance literature. In its current form, HAZEL runs on a GPT 3.5-turbo model that has been tailored to provide suggestions in accordance with HE's tone of voice and style requirements. In this repository, you will find some general information about large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) along with a prompt library that you may wish to consult while working with HAZEL.
